#### Locus of control

Relates to how much control a person believe their abilities to affect events around them.

Internal locus of control students believes success and failure lies within self rather than without (external), and thus is more likely to be successful

Developed in 1966, by Rotter

Internal locus + :

Generally more successful, work hard, less likely to be influenced, take Responsibility

Internal locus - :



External Locus + :

Good team player, can let go of stress, happier

How to internalize locus:

* set goals
* develop your problem solving skills
* care for self-talk

Xinyue - more internal - internal locus more eager for success and result-driven
Alvin - change overtime - emphasis on adaptability of control when you grow older
